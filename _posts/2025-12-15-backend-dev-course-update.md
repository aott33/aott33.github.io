## Introduction

As you may have noticed, I have not been posting about my homelab for the last few weeks. I have shifted focus to completing my backend developer program on Boot.dev. I have been making great progress and acheived the highly sought after Archmage status.

## Background & Context

This is week 3 of a 16-week journey documenting my Homelab building process. Week 1 established the network foundation with OPNsense and WiFi. Week 2 added VLAN segmentation for OT/IT security. This week was meant to deploy the Kubernetes control plane on my gaming PC, but hardware had other plans.

**This post's goals:**
1. Walk through why Boot.dev is a great coding platform
2. My recent progress and what I like most about Boot.dev
3. Introduce my capstone project
