# Testing out the Frankenstein Automation Gateway

Several months ago I found the [Frankenstein Automation Gateway](https://github.com/vogler75/automation-gateway) and thought it looked pretty interesting.
I didn't end up testing the Automation Gateway until this weekend and thought it was a great way to access my OPC UA server via MQTT and GraphQL.

Testing out this gateway was a great way to learn about APIs, specifically, GraphQL. You can see the [Resources Page](Resources.md) for links that I found helpful to learn about APIs.
