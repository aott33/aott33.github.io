# Testing out the Frankenstein Automation Gateway

Several months ago I found the [Frankenstein Automation Gateway](https://github.com/vogler75/automation-gateway) and thought it looked pretty interesting.
I didn't end up testing the Automation Gateway until this weekend and thought it was a great way to access my OPC UA server via MQTT and GraphQL.

Prior to this weekend, I had very little experience working with APIs. So, testing out this gateway was a great way to learn about APIs, specifically, GraphQL. See the [Resources Page](/Resources.md#apis) for helpful API resources.

## Steps taken:
- Go to [Frankenstein Automation Gateway](https://github.com/vogler75/automation-gateway) and review the documentation
