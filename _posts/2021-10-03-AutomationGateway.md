# Testing out the Frankenstein Automation Gateway

Several months ago I found the [Frankenstein Automation Gateway](https://github.com/vogler75/automation-gateway) and thought it looked pretty interesting.
I didn't end up testing the Automation Gateway until this weekend and thought it was a great way to access my OPC UA server via MQTT and GraphQL.

Prior to this weekend, I had very little experience working with APIs. So, testing out this gateway was a great way to learn about APIs, specifically, GraphQL. See the [Resources Page](/Resources.md#apis) for helpful API resources.

## Steps taken:
- Go to [Frankenstein Automation Gateway](https://github.com/vogler75/automation-gateway) and review the documentation 
- Pull the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocworks/automation-gateway)

  `docker pull rocworks/automation-gateway`

  Note: Ensure that you have docker installed. I am using the [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)
