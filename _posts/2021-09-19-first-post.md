## First Blog Post

First off, thanks to Chad Baldwin and his tutorial on [Building a Free Blog with GitHub Pages in Minutes](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html).
This tutorial helped me get started with setting this blog up.

### The goal of this blog:
Help build my Industry 4.0 ["expertise, network, and second brain" by learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/).

### How will I develop my Industry 4.0 Knowlege?
The main source of my learning will be the [Industry 4.0 Mentorship](https://www.iiot.university/mentorship-program).

The second source of my learning will be the [Industry 4.0 Community Discord](https://www.iiot.university/discord).

This mentorship program has been very beneficial in developing my Industry 4.0 Skills. I am very thankful for the team at 4.0 Solutions (Walker Reynolds, Zack Scriven,
Vaughn Turner, and others who have helped develop the mentorship program). I am also very thankful for all the members of the Industry 4.0 Community Discord and the knoweldge
that is shared in the community.
