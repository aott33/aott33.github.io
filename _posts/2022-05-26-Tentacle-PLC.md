## Introduction:
### What is Tentacle PLC?
```
Tentacle PLC is a modern Soft PLC runtime with the basic features of a traditional programmable logic controller platform, but the process logic is written in Javascript.

### Why am I testing Tentacle PLC?
- I am taking a full-stack engineering program and learning JavaScript. So, I thought this would be a good opportunity to continue developing my skills while testing out what I believe is a great soft PLC project.
