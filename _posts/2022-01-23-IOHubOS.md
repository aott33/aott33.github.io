## Introduction:
### What is IOhubOS?
```
IOhubOS is a Linux-based distro designed for Industrial and IIoT environments, ready to run Docker-based applications.
```

### Why am I testing IOhubOS?
- I tested the EZvpn IOX1/IOhub at work and think it is a very powerful IIoT platform. When I heard about the IOhubOS release, I wanted to test it out and see how I could leverage the open source IOhub firmware.
- Below are the reasons why I think the EZvpn IOX1 is a great [device for Remote Assistance and IIoT Data Management](https://iocondocs.ezvpn.online/hardware/iox1#description).
  - The VPN service was quick and easy to set up
  - IOhub is a very powerful IIoT platform that made it very easy manage data from the field
  - The IOhub documentation is very well done and easy to follow due to the tutorial style
- Because of the above reasons, I thought it would be worthwhile to test out IOHubOS
