## Introduction:
### What is IOhubOS?
```
IOhubOS is a Linux-based distro designed
for Industrial and IIoT environments, 
ready to run Docker-based applications.
```
- Excerpt from [IOhubOS GitHub Repo](https://github.com/iohubos/iohubos#introduction) is 

### Why am I testing IOhubOS?
- I tested the EZvpn IOX1/IOhub at work and think it is a very powerful IIoT platform. When I heard about the IOhubOS release, I wanted to test it out and see how I could leverage the open source IOhub firmware.
- Below are the reasons why I think the EZvpn IOX1 is a great [device for Remote Assistance and IIoT Data Management](https://iocondocs.ezvpn.online/hardware/iox1#description).
  - The VPN service was quick and easy to set up
  - IOhub is a very powerful IIoT platform that made it very easy manage data from the field
  - The IOhub documentation is very well done and easy to follow due to the tutorial style
- Because of the above reasons, I thought it would be worthwhile to test out IOHubOS

## Hardware:
### IOhubOS Minimum Hardware Requirements:
- x86_64 architecture (ARM compatibility will follow)
- 1GbByte of RAM
- 16GByte of storage
- One or two network adapters

### Install IOHubOS:
- Connect the USB hub to the USB port on the UNO 2271G
- Connect the USB flashed with the installer.img to the USB hub connected to the UNO 2271G
- Connect keyboard to the USB Hub connected to the UNO 2271G
- Connect monitor to HDMI port on UNO 2271G
- Connect power to the the UNO 2271G
    - Wiring Diagram - TODO
- Click power button
- Run ```iohub-installer <destination disk device> [<first network adapter>]```
    - If destination disk device is unknown, run the ```lsblk``` command
    - The run command for the UNO 2271G is ```iohub-installer /dev/mmcblk0```
- Enter new root password
- Once IOHubOS is installed, it will ask you to press enter to shut down the system
    - I got the couple errors when pressing enter
```	
[FAILED] Failed unmounting /run/live/medium
[  410.401822] [760] Failed to unmount /run/live/medium: Device or resource busy
[  410.406843] systemd-shutdown[1]: could not detach loopback /dev/loop0: Device or resource busy
[  410.409277] systemd-shutdown[1]: Failed to finalize file systems, loop devices, ignoring
```
- After a forced shutdown, I removed the USB and rebooted the UNO 2271G
- Once the system is started, after a few seconds, you will see on the console a message with the name of the network interface used to connect to the network and its IP address
    - Example: ```Eth0:192.168.1.68```
- Once IP address was identified, I used PuTTY to connect

### Configure IOHubOS:
- Most of the IOHubOS can be configured by editing the ```/iohub/envvars/``` file
    - ``` nano /iohub/envvars/```
    
    <kbd> <img src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48938478/150683746-06887fe2-ed02-4097-a961-f2a87b94aaf3.png /> </kbd>

- I changed the following env variables:
```
IOHUBOS_TIMEZONE='Canada/Pacific'
IOHUBOS_NETWORK_MODE='router'

#Only for router mode.
#Only static mode is supported.
IOHUBOS_ETH1_DEVICE='enp2s0'
IOHUBOS_ETH1_IP='192.168.178.253'
IOHUBOS_ETH1_NETMASK='255.255.255.0' 

## === dhcp server configuration ===
IOHUBOS_DHCP_SERVER_ENABLED='true'          # dhcp server on eth1
IOHUBOS_DHCP_SERVER_FROM='192.168.178.200'  # e.g. 10.11.12.100
IOHUBOS_DHCP_SERVER_TO='192.168.178.250'    # e.g. 10.11.12.199
IOHUBOS_DHCP_SERVER_DNS='8.8.8.8'           # comma separated list, e.g. 192.168.190.1, 8.8.8.8

## === firewall configuration ===
IOHUBOS_FIREWALL_ROUTER_TO_INTERNET = 'true'
```
    
- If you do not know the name of the ETH1 network device, you can run the ```lshw -class network -short``` command to get a list of available network devices.
    - My second ethernet device name is ```enp2s0```

- After these steps, the IOHubOS is running

## Challenges:
- ***SOLVED***-Challenge 1 - DHCP  server is not working SOLVED
    - SOLUTION: define the DNS in the environment variables file. I left it undefined initially
- ***SOLVED***-Challenge 2 - nable to connect to the internet when connected to the ETH1
    - SOLUTION: define the DNS in the environment variables file. I left it undefined initially

## Summary:
- Overall, this OS is realetively easy to install and configure and I look forward to deploying some docker applications. I received some excellent assistance from the IOHubOS developer.

## Next Steps:
- Deploy Docker applications on the IOHubOS
- Test out the VPN functionality once it is released
