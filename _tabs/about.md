## Home

The goal of this blog is to help build my Automation Software Engineer ([SASE](https://sase.space/){:target="_blank"}) skillset by [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/){:target="_blank"}.

I document my journey building:
- Kubernetes homelab for OT/IT environments
- SCADA and IIoT solutions
- Industrial automation projects
- Backend and DevOps skills

Follow along as I learn, build, and share technical knowledge in real-time.
